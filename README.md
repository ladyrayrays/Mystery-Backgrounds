<h1>Brief Description</h1>
<p>This Project was created in the Spring of 2019 for a Senior Project class I took during my Undergraduate years. The purpose of this project was to be a refresher on Java and learn GUI's. The goal of the project was to create 90s/00s screen savers.</p>

<h2>What This Project Contains</h2>
<p>This Project contains 3 different backgrounds and a main menu.
Files Assocatied with Main Project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BallAnimation4.java</li>

<h2>How to Run Project</h2>
<p>The panel.java file created the panels for the main menu, run this file to start the project.</p>
